# msci-nlp-w22

WELCOME

Note: I created repository msci-nlp-w22-2 and added Peyman Mohseni Kiasari as a collaborator on that also in order to submit Assignment 2 since I couldn't figure         out how to upload the folder without creating a submodule.
      I have since transferred assignment 2 over to this github repository properly.
      The paper trail is visible for times of submission by checking the other repository.
      This shouldn't be an issue as I have now learnt and know how to do it properly.
      
      Thanks for understanding!
